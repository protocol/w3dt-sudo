# Lotus / Filecoin RPC and JavaScript Library Audit

**2021-04/05** by Protocol Labs W3DT Team Sudo

This report captures a condensed summary of a brief audit conducted of the current state of the JavaScript ecosystem surrounding Filecoin and the affordances provided to JavaScript developers via the Lotus RPC API. The audit was conducted to increase familiarity with the current Filecoin JavaScript ecosystem and to inform possible future work in this space to increase value for web3 developers building on Filecoin.

Action items and recommendations in this report can be identified by the following labels:

* ***(TODO TASK)*** - A small task that is less than project-sized but recommended.
* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** - A larger set of work that could be scoped into a project for Protocol Labs' W3DT or a Devgrant.
* ***(NEEDS INVESTIGATION)*** - Further investigation work necessary or recommended.

## Lotus RPC API

### General RPC API Findings

The majority of investigation into the Lotus RPC API was conducted via the [js-lotus-client](#js-lotus-client) library and the [OpenRPC support](#openrpc-support). Action items relating to Lotus can be found in the sections below.

### [OpenRPC support](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/build/openrpc)

> JSON based API definition of the lotus json-rpc interfaces that are auto-generated from the code.

[Developed](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4711) under a [Devgrant](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/pull/165) and [merged in Lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5843) in late March, 2021.

#### Maturity

The Good:
- It is generated from the Go RPC implementation, so is always up to date.
- It could be used to generate API docs and (almost complete) TypeScript and Rust clients.

The Bad:
- TypeScript declarations do not take optional parameters into consideration, which makes all parameters required in a TypeScript project.
- Not yet auto-discoverable or usable with existing tools like https://playground.open-rpc.org (the API definition doc should be discoverable from the API, but currently isn't, perhaps due to auth, TBC).

Last updated: 31 March 2021 _(auto genereated from RPC code changes)_

https://github.com/protocol/w3dt-sudo/pull/16#issuecomment-820864315

#### Key Findings

N/A

#### Recommendations

* ***(NEEDS INVESTIGATION)*** We should investigate and enable auto-discovery and doc generation from a Lotus endpoint URL. As a workaround, it can be done by manually extracting the definition files, e.g.:
https://playground.open-rpc.org/?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/olizilla/fc6abf836023b6ee662955695f1cfd21/raw/a4cb5aa3c6fbbc47bcf4b92d2370b8b012a810cb/full.json
* API client generation is possible for TypeScript and Rust, but [it's rough](https://github.com/olizilla/lotus-openrpc-client/blob/main/client/typescript/src/index.ts#L280). This could be improved by adding more detail to the Lotus OpenRPC definition (we should do that) but may also require improving the OpenRPC/generator project.
  * Notably, we cannot define the Lotus file import API with OpenRPC, as it only specifies how to define JSON payloads and the file import API uses a separate workflow, so we will always need a custom step to create a client or docs that includes the file import API.
  * Some [input on this has been provided by an OpenRPC maintainer](https://github.com/protocol/w3dt-sudo/pull/16#issuecomment-820864315) in response to our investivation and we may see improvements upstream that unlock more potential here.
* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** We should simplify the custom code generation for https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-schema and using a single method would be ideal, since we have OpenRPC it may be the best approach to reduce the number of toolchains we need and use.

#### Experiments

Exploration: https://github.com/olizilla/lotus-openrpc-client

### lotus-gateway

https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/cmd/lotus-gateway

*We did not cover the lotus-gateway during our investigation but it remains relevant and should be included in any further investigation.*

## filecoin-shipyard JavaScript libraries

Many of the libraries in filecoin-shipyard were not investigated in depth as they are largely unmaintained and are primarily designed for narrow feature-set and/or example use.

***(TODO TASK)*** Due to the fast-changing nature of the Filecoin protocol and Lotus, as well as the fact that many of these libraries are built using premature assumptions about usability of the network (e.g. deal size), it is likely that any project listed below that has not been updated during 2021 is out of date and should be marked as archived. We should be careful to set expectations to users about what they can expect from these projects.

### [js-lotus-client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client)

> The [lotus JS client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client) is a collection of small JS libraries, which enables developers to interact with Lotus via it’s JSON-RPC API.

It is decoupled in:

- [Schema](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-schema): contains schemas for JSON data representation compatible with Lotus JSON-RPC API.
- Provider libraries ([Node.js](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-provider-nodejs) and [browser](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-provider-browser)): inspired by “providers” in the Ethereum ecossystem, a provider links to a running node exposing interface that connects to a Lotus JSON-RPC API endpoint using WebSockets or HTTP.
- [RPC](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-rpc): used together with a schema for creating the RPC messages from function parameters.

#### Maturity

The Good:
- It is generated from the Go RPC implementation, so is always up to date (as long as the generation is re-run). See the two [`go-`](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-schema) directories in [js-lotus-client-schem](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-schema) for the custom codegen.
- It could be used to generate API docs and (almost complete) TypeScript declarations.

The Bad:
- TypeScript declarations do not have into consideration optional parameters, which makes them required in a TypeScript project.
- A large number of unanswered open issues.

#### Key Findings

* The `client.clientDealSize` seems problematic. The expectation per the naming would be to get the actual pieceSize to provide, but getting: `unexpected deal status while waiting for data request: 11 (StorageDealFailing). Provider message: deal rejected: proposal piece size is invalid: padded piece size must be a power of 2`
* List miners takes a really long time.
* The different workflow required for the file import API is not clear, especially to those not familiar with Lotus mechanics.
* Authentication tokens requirements seem too strict.
  * Some methods, including `listDeals` need write permissions. `ClientStartDeal` needs admin permissions.
  * The RPC API seems to target users who own a lotus instance, instead of a general user. But, in the client this is not clear at all.

#### Recommendations

* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** Build guided examples where it is clear to the user what needs to be changed and what happens behind the scenes
  * A simple example of creating a deal should exist, including how to import a file using the Provider which is not clear unless one asks someone with knowledge on creating deals.
* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** We should identify optional parameters and default values in the docs and TypeScript definitions. It is not clear which parameters are required and optional. Moreover, TypeScript use is impractical without this clarification.
* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** Custom codegen could be completely (or mostly?) replaced with OpenRPC codegen. See above.
* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** Codegen in https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-schema should be performed on each major Lotus release, with a new npm version published. A GitHub action to PR changes seems like a reasonable step, but it also needs a clear *owner* to ensure versions get published.

#### Experiments

Explorations:

- [connect-lotus-client-with-deployed-lotus-instance.md](https://github.com/protocol/w3dt-sudo/blob/master/home/vasco-santos/2021-02-exploration-report-connect-lotus-client-with-deployed-lotus-instance.md)
- [js-lotus-client.md](https://github.com/protocol/w3dt-sudo/blob/master/home/vasco-santos/2021-03-exploration-report-1-on-js-lotus-client.md)

### [Filecoin.js](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/filecoin.js)

> A JavaScript (and TypeScript) library for interacting with the Filecoin's Lotus node, with support for external signers.

This work was funded by a Devgrant, intending to be familiar to [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) users, but development was paused due to lack of adoption and some difficulties with the message handling/signing workflow.

#### Maturity

The current state of the library specified in the README is `ALPHA: things will not work or work incorectly, will break and the API will change! ⚠️`

Taking into account the activity of the repo, it has not been in actively development since November 2020, relying on an outdated fork of `filecoin-signing-tools-js`. There is a [Roadmap Issue](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/filecoin.js/issues/1) where we can see that general Filecoin operations are no yet implemented.

The latest version in npm is `"0.0.5-alpha"`, however the `package.json` in GitHub shows `"0.0.3-alpha"`, so there may be more recent code not pushed to GitHub.

Last updated: 17 Nov 2020

#### Key Findings

- Supports Wallet Mnemonics
- The roadmap indicates that more general Filecoin operations might get implemented in the future.
- Tests are failing to run, even by trying to run a shell script as done in CI. In the latest commits, CI did also not run.

#### Recommendations

***(NEEDS INVESTIGATION)*** Look into what is happening with the versioning and whether there's code not pushed to GitHub.

***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** Consider re-starting this work to make a more complete JavaScript API library for dapp developers. Needs planning and scoping.

Minor items arising out of investigation that could be followed up within a project:

* Exported `WsJsonRpcConnector` and `HttpJsonRpcConnector` seem the same as [@filecoin-shipyard/lotus-client-provider-nodejs](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-provider-nodejs) + [@filecoin-shipyard/lotus-client-provider-browser]([@filecoin-shipyard/lotus-client-provider](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-provider)-browser), which abstracts the WS or HTTP, but also supports both.
  * We should converge the providers/connectors into a single library
* An isomorphic fetch implementation should be used
* Interact with traditional wallet providers like metamask (could not get it up and running)
  * We should work towards a frictionless experience and/or a general improvement on the documentation for this core functionality provided

#### Experiments

See https://github.com/protocol/w3dt-sudo/blob/master/home/vasco-santos/2021-03-audit-filecoinjs.md for an in-depth exploration and experiments in attempting to use Filecoin.js

## filecoin-shipyard JavaScript Example Apps

> Three of the example apps are currently described in the official Filecoin documentation at <https://docs.filecoin.io/build/examples/>. However, they have not been actively maintained and rely on older components that are unlikely to still be operaitonal. In addition, the linked examples focus on small-deals, which are currently not optimal for Filecoin deal-making.

### Recommendations

We should consider updating the documentation for these examples to suggest their state as operational against pre-mainnet Filecoin and relying on possibly outdated components. ~~They should also be removed from docs.filecoin.io until we can update them and ensure they demonstrate ideal working conditions for Filecoin.~~ (They were removed during the compilation of this report).

***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** [filecoin-shipyard/filecoin-network-inspector](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/filecoin-network-inspector) may be the example application most worth focusing on updating since it doesn't rely on small deals and exercises basic parts of the Lotus RPC.

## filecoin-shipyard JavaScript go-filecoin Projects

Mostly based on the unmaintained `filecoin-api-client` library. These libraries have not been touched since September 2019, based on an old version of go-filecoin and may not have any utility even with venus, the renamed go-filecoin, which has evolved significantly since September 2019.

### Recommendations

***(TODO TASK)*** These projects should be placed into the GitHub "archived" state, with clear notices in their README about their status as not up-to-date examples. Further development work should not be ruled out on these projects, and a path to re-starting them should be documented in their README (e.g. "Contact ... at ... if you would like to re-start this project and contribute fixes to make it usable").

### https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-filecoin-api-client

> API client for go-filecoin.

#### Recommendations

We should ask the maintainers of Venus if they would like to do anything with this in the short-term, if not, it should be archived.

> A lightweight web interface to send and receive Filecoin via your Ledger device

##### Key Findings

It's a production app. It's not directly re-usable and it's not yet suffciently documented to be an introductory educational resource, but it is useful as a well built and tested example of an app that talks to Lotus, does something useful, and uses a popular UI stack (next.js, react, redux).

##### Recommendations

* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** Adding an architecture diagram and an explanation of how the parts fit together would go along way to making wallet an educational resource for web3 app developers.

#### https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages

> Dependents of https://github.com/glifio/wallet, some are also useful by themselves. It's a lerna repo, commits every month, and the project builds and works out of the box. Each module is explored below

##### [@glif/filecoin-address](https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages/filecoin-address)

> This is a JS implementation of the Filecoin address type, inspired by go-address. It can create new address instances and encode addresses, and it takes care of decoding and validating checksums.

This is a good library, and serves an important purpose. We could consider adopting it into the filecoin-project org to give more visibilty, or at a minimum enhancing our documentation to make it obvious for web3 app developers ***(TODO TASK)***.

##### [@glif/filecoin-message-confirmer](https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages/filecoin-message-confirmer)

Poll the StateSearchMsg API method to verify that a specfied message CID appears on-chain with a 0 exit-code reciept. Uses `@glif/filecoin-rpc-client`.

A reasonable solution given the current API. 

###### Recommendations

* ***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)*** We should explore a better API for waiting for a message to succesfully execute.
- ***(TODO TASK)*** Need to fix https://github.com/glifio/modules/issues/65 ("filecoin-message-confirmer should verify the response message CID")

##### [@glif/filecoin-message](https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages/filecoin-message)

Normalises the casing of message object keys between Lotus and Zondax. If you need to talk to both, you are going to want to avoid dealing with the fact that lotus uses upper-camel case `GasFeeCap` and zondax uses all lower case `gasfeecap`.

##### [@glif/filecoin-number](https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages/filecoin-number)

A wrapper class for bignumber.js to represent an amount of FIL which may be larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 - 1). Provides conversion from attoFIL to picoFIL to FIL, and a Currency Conversion api which uses a remote service to provide the exchange rate.

Dealing with FIL numbers and their various fractional forms is a very common operation for dealing with Filecoin so this library, or some incarnation of the basic concepts, has potential to be critical ot the JavaScript Filecoin ecosystem.

###### Recommendations

***(POSSIBLE PROJECT)***

- Review and potentially replace with a lighter / more ergonimic alternative. 
- We should explore the ideal API for this representing FIL amounts.
- Consider using a lighter lib for big number support https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/wiki
- Consider just using the built-in BigInt https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt
- Currency conversion should be a seperate utility as many use-cases will not need it.

##### [@glif/filecoin-rpc-client](https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages/filecoin-rpc-client)

**TL;DR** Too bare-bones for general consumption, but a good example for folks who like it minimal.

A very light [(~70 LoC) wrapper](https://github.com/glifio/modules/blob/9b97f31054c20b39b8a75d30727fa33162715dab/packages/filecoin-rpc-client/src/index.ts) around `axios` to create JSON RPC requests.

- 👍 lightweight, low maintenance, never out of date, easy to understand.
- 👍 lovely docs https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4872192/SWLh5mUd?version=latest
- ❌ methods passed as string arg. No API, no types, no way to discover the API from your IDE.
- ❌ you've got to parse filecoin responses manually
- ❌ CID params are awkward. Must be passed as a ipld-json link `{ '/': '<cid string>' }`

##### [@glif/filecoin-wallet-provider](https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages/filecoin-wallet-provider)

Abstraction layer for filecoin wallet implementations. A good example to explore, but needs more iterations before it's something we should recommend to folks, and it's unlikely to get that attention in the near future.

Aims at being a facade over different filecoin impl providers, to provide a common API and re-use common / computable methods where possible. Ideally a povider impl adds implementations of sensitive functions / primatives while non-senstive / high-level ones are provided by this module.

##### [@glif/react-components](https://github.com/glifio/modules/tree/primary/packages/react-components)

Not for general consumption. Has some nice UI components, but folks can explore the wallet app to see them, and get the most up to date versions.

#### Maturity

Currently in `v.0.15.0`, this library is widely used, has been actively maintained over the last months and is the go to library for signing related operations in the ecosystem. It offers all the needed cryptographic primitives to interact with a Lotus node.

Main users include:
- `filecoin.js`
- `ceramicnetwork/cli`
  - A CLI that allows you to interact with the Ceramic protocol.
- `@nodefactory/filsnap`
  - Metamask snap (plugin) to enable Metamask users interaction with filecoin dapps.
- `@glif/local-managed-provider`

Last updated: 29 Apr 2021

#### Key Findings

- Per [https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools/issues/373](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools/issues/373), [Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools#358](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools/issues/358), [Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools#356](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools/issues/356) and [Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools#352](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools/issues/352), there are a few issues with bundlers and browsers.
- Per [Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools#368](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools/issues/368) and [Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools#343](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-signing-tools/issues/343), there are several issues with WASM.  The browser WASM example uses the pure JS implementation and an issue tracking how wasm is being loaded in the browser. Could not find any project leveraging the WASM library. Is it working?

  - BLS
  - Filecoin transactions (CBOR <> JSON serialization)
  - Multisig (in progress)
3. JSON RPC Server
  - Exposes most of the functions available in the signing library

##### Cryptographic primitives

1. `generateMnemonic`
2. `keyDerive`
3. `keyDeriveFromSeed`
4. `keyRecover`
5. `transactionSerialize`
6. `transactionSerializeRaw`
7. `transactionParse`
8. `transactionSign`
9. `transactionSignLotus`
10. `transactionSignRaw`
11. `verifySignature`
12. `addressAsBytes`
13.  `bytesToAddress`

All available via Rust, WASM (browser and Node.js) and JSON RPC Server.

#### Overall Recommendations

- The [documentation site](https://zondax.ch/updating-documentation) as the main source for docs should be available. It has been on maintenance, which makes it difficult to understand what methods are supported unless we check the code/tests and this should be handled.
- Clarify WASM library status per above findings
- Friction onboarding
  - Several examples are provided, but some are not easy to run and do not have instructions. It would be extremely valuable for the community to have instructions for running this examples together with some educational content regarding what are the use cases for each and what happens under the hood.
- Run the WASM code in the browser and compare the bundle size with the pure JS implementation
