## Forage / @andrew

What weâ€™ve been up to:

- metadata and proxy responses stored on ipfs
- json (ipld-ish) representations of versions and packages
- upgraded to latest js-ipfs releases
- various bug fixes
- [released v0.0.17](https://github.com/foragepm/forage/releases/tag/v0.0.17)

This weekâ€™s activities:

- share metadata+responses over pubsub
- export metadata+responses along with archives
- investigate signing and trusting instances
    - can we reuse ipfs pub/priv keys?

#### Gateway++ / IPFS Reimagined

IPFS Reimagined workstream proposal: https://www.notion.so/protocollabs/IPFS-Reimagined-2054b59bd8af4c9794486c7726021aa1#526727af2d934a4aa1c6c408aa8ccd51 *(private link)*

* https://github.com/olizilla/ipfs-get
* now do the reverse!
* ipfs-unixfs* - trim them down? new dag-pb stack (fewer dependencies), make mfs and rabin optional?
* RV: suggest we just make little, independent tools for now, work on integrating into something more modular later - focus on patterns, size, simplicity, dependency depth for now, experiment. Make tools easily testable - how?

**Large provider DHT** (2nd-level DHT)

* https://www.notion.so/protocollabs/IPFS-for-NFT-DApps-d9a60743ae3e459ca6f7c9e22508d862#c0be9e9f2a774d288ff965159dd714e8  *(private link)*
* Has buy-in from Adin
