## Forage / @andrew

What weâ€™ve been up to:

- reworked logging to output to a file if running in electron [#94ffe6](https://github.com/foragepm/forage/commit/94ffe6ecfc532fa69da4b91b11faa856d852e265)
- debugged and fixed an issue with unusual file encoding in go modules [#42adb65](https://github.com/foragepm/forage/commit/42adb65119fa5bb997f07dc073d771a9c20b7a6d)
- benchmarking various scenarios [#26f237c](https://github.com/foragepm/forage/commit/26f237c65f539337d65475b245e6235a99466493) 
- faster response to want/have requests
- proxy servers now attempt want/have fetch from ipfs

This weekâ€™s activities:

- stat archives over ipfs before loading
  - fail faster if no response to `stat`
  - enforce max file size to load over ipfs
  - change ipfs timeout based on file size
- proxy servers need to use a queue when adding archives to ipfs to avoid overwhelming it
- add integrity checking of responses to want/have requests
- spike out sharing signed metadata

## Project Sync

What we've been up to:

 * @rvagg:
     * IPFS Collections
         - see https://www.notion.so/IPFS-Collections-Technical-Vision-dd1f455b813a4643815ee26eb319810b *(private link)* for an initial technical vision proposal
         - had product review with various technical folks, poked holes, iterating toward a shared vision ([notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hoP_ujOmgMcQMNcjA9VxdfGU1pnVbXibxHTXAUhiCEI/edit#heading=h.kndk6ziaqfcz) *(private link)*)
         - need to work on interfaces - how might users _use_ this thing?
         - need to clarify scope of definition - where does a collection stop, what _is_ a collection vs the data it's collecting?
     * What's next for Sudo! Iterating through issues thrown up by [Gateway++](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/100) with @olizilla. Wrapping in a workstream "IPFS Reimagined" (discuss later in meeting).
